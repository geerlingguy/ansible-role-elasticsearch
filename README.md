# Ansible Role: Elasticsearch

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ansible-role-elasticsearch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ansible-role-elasticsearch)

An Ansible Role that installs Elasticsearch on RedHat/CentOS or Debian/Ubuntu.

## Requirements

Requires at least Java 8. See [`geerlingguy.java`](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-java#example-playbook-install-openjdk-8) role instructions for installing OpenJDK 8.

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

    elasticsearch_version: '7.x'

The major version to use when installing Elasticsearch.

    elasticsearch_package_version: ''

The package version to use when installing Elasticsearch.

    elasticsearch_package_state: present

The `elasticsearch` package state; set to `latest` to upgrade or change versions.

    elasticsearch_service_state: started
    elasticsearch_service_enabled: true

Controls the Elasticsearch service options.

    elasticsearch_network_host: localhost

Network host to listen for incoming connections on. By default we only listen on the localhost interface. Change this to the IP address to listen on a specific interface, or `0.0.0.0` to listen on all interfaces.

    elasticsearch_http_port: 9200

The port to listen for HTTP connections on.

    elasticsearch_heap_size_min: 1g

The minimum jvm heap size.

    elasticsearch_heap_size_max: 2g

The maximum jvm heap size.

    elasticsearch_extra_options: ''

A placeholder for arbitrary configuration options not exposed by the role. This will be appended as-is to the end of the `elasticsearch.yml` file, as long as your variable preserves formatting with a `|`. For example:

```yaml
elasticsearch_extra_options: |  # Dont forget the pipe!
  some.option: true
  another.option: false
```
