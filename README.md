# Ansible Role: Elasticsearch

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ansible-role-elasticsearch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ansible-role-elasticsearch)

An Ansible Role that installs Elasticsearch on RedHat/CentOS or Debian/Ubuntu.

## Requirements

Requires at least Java 8. See [`geerlingguy.java`](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-java#example-playbook-install-openjdk-8) role instructions for installing OpenJDK 8.

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

    elasticsearch_version: '6.x'

The major version to use when installing Elasticsearch.

    elasticsearch_package_state: present

The `elasticsearch` package state; set to `latest` to upgrade or change versions.

    elasticsearch_service_state: started
    elasticsearch_service_enabled: true

Controls the Elasticsearch service options.

    elasticsearch_network_host: localhost

Network host to listen for incoming connections on. By default we only listen on the localhost interface. Change this to the IP address to listen on a specific interface, or `0.0.0.0` to listen on all interfaces.

    elasticsearch_http_port: 9200

The port to listen for HTTP connections on.

    elasticsearch_extra_options: ''

Extra options that will be templated into the configuration. This allows for extra configuration outside of the base scope of the role. The string is templated directly into the configuration file.
